# 🩺 Breast Cancer Risk Prediction (10-Year Mortality)

🎓 **Capstone Project**  
Developed as part of my Master's Diploma in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at the Boston Institute of Analytics


## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive machine learning model that estimates the **10-year mortality risk** for breast cancer patients, aiding clinicians in early risk stratification and improved treatment planning.


## 🧠 Techniques & Tools Used

- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** on clinical breast cancer data
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and correlations
- Built and evaluated multiple classification models to predict mortality risk
- Selected the best model based on **performance metrics and ROC curve**
- Provided actionable **data-driven insights** for risk categories

## 📁 Files Included

- `breast_cancer_model.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and model
- `README.md` – Project overview and summary

## 📊 Outcome

- Achieved **high prediction accuracy** and a strong AUC score on validation data
- Identified key features affecting breast cancer mortality risk (e.g., age, hormone status, tumor size)

## 💡 Future Scope

- Incorporate deep learning models for improved accuracy  
- Deploy the model via Flask or Streamlit for real-time risk predictions  
- Integrate with healthcare dashboards for visual storytelling
